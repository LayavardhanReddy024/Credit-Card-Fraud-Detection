# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

# Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation

# Objective

Identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

1.Data Preprocessing:

 * Load and explore the credit card dataset.
 * Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
 * Balance the dataset using upsampling.
 
2.Feature Engineering:

 * Create features from categorical data using LabelEncoder.
 * Drop unnecessary columns and split data into features and target variables.

3.Model Training and Evaluation:

 * Train a RandomForestClassifier on the training data.
 * Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews 
   correlation coefficient
 * Visualize confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.
